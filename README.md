Track and diff Certificate Transparency Log Policies

## Adding / Updating
This doesn't occur very often so the process is not scripted at the
moment.

- Install [Typora](https://typora.io/#download)
- Open Typora
- Open the HTML or PDF containing the policy text
- Copy the relevant contents of the page
- Paste the policy text into Typora
- Select-all and copy (Typora will automatically put the
  contents as Markdown into your clipboard)
- Open the existing or new policy file in an IDE of your own choosing
- Paste the content into the existing or new policy file

### Why Typora?
Typora has excellent
[support](https://support.typora.io/Copy-and-Paste/) for converting the
RTF copied onto most OS clipboards into modern Github-flavored markdown.
